# Machine Learning Project: Data Preparation and Model Training

## Overview
This project demonstrates the process of preparing a dataset for machine learning, followed by training and evaluating models. The data has been preprocessed to ensure it is numerical, clean, and free from missing values. After preprocessing, various machine learning models were applied to predict [add the target variable or objective].

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the raw and preprocessed datasets.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing and model training.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks documenting the step-by-step analysis.
- `models/`: Saved machine learning models and results.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project.

## Dataset
- The dataset used in this project contains features that have been preprocessed to ensure suitability for machine learning models.
- **Preprocessing Steps:**
  - All features have been transformed into numerical values.
  - Missing values have been handled appropriately.
  - Feature scaling has been applied where necessary.

### Target Variable
- The target variable for this project is **[target]**, which we aim to predict using the available features.

## Data Preprocessing
This workflow assumes the dataset is ready for machine learning, meaning:
- All categorical variables have been encoded into numerical values using [encoding technique, e.g., Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding].
- Missing values have been imputed using [imputation technique, e.g., mean, median, mode].
- Features have been standardized or normalized using [scaling method, e.g., StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler].

## Machine Learning Models
After preprocessing, several machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including:
- Random Forest Classifier


### Model Evaluation
Each model was evaluated using:
- **Accuracy** on the test set
- **Cross-Validation Score** (5-fold cross-validation)
